Q1.Goal: find average of all the even integers keyed in.
Users will key in only integers greater than 0 one at a time
users should key in -1 to exit
You should print Average is 0 if no even positive integer is keyed in  

Round all outputs to 2dp 



Q2.Consider the following code

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 2, c = 8;
    double result = a + b / c * a - b;
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}

The output is 3 which is wrong.Correct the code to give the correct value of 4.25. Show ur output to ur lecturer.
