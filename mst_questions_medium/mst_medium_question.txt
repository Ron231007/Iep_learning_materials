Q1.Write a C++ program that allows the user to choose a mathematical operation using a menu 
and then applies that operation to a sequence of integers from 1 to a user-specified number n.

The menu should look like this:

Welcome to this simple calculator
1. Sum of first n integers
2. Product of first n integers
3. Average of first n integers (as double)
4. Print all even numbers from 1 to n
5. Quit


The program should not end until 5 is keyed in.
If 5 is keyed in as the first value, do not ask them to key in n value. 
Simply print exited and quit the program.
For 5., simply print the word "Exited" and quit the program
The user will only key in integers 
if a user enters an invalid number, do not ask for n 
simply print "Invalid choice" 
Print the menu with only one line

For this problem, when defining all ur switch cases, make sure to add {} to avoid problems for syntax
so it would look like switch(condition)
                        {
                            case 1:
                            {
                                ....
                                break;
                            }
                            ...
                        
                        }
Q2.Consider the following code

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 2, c = 8;
    double result = a + b / c * a - b;
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}

The output is 3 which is wrong.Correct the code to give the correct value of 4.25. Show ur output to ur lecturer.
