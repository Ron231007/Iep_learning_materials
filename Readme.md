This is NOT all you need to know but most of it. Do read up more and code urselfs to better understand how this language works. Do note that in this module, you will be understanding codes more than you have to code. This means that the syntax may not be as important as understanding how it work.


The files for for and while loops are more than just the syntax. They include solutions on how to better use these loops. The MOST important file you MUST understand is the function.cpp file as it will be about 40% of your final exam. This, however, is also the most confusing chapter. Do take the time to ensure that you fully understand this file thoroughly. U must understand the concepts of: 1) How to define a function(this syntax is important as they seem to love to test this),  2)parameters/argument 3)function call 4)Local vs Global variables 5) pass by value(u need not know pass by reference for this module) 6)Reason for using functions.

Arrays:

In this module, u will need to learn 2d arrays too unfortunately. Arrays are like a way to declare alot of variables without having to declare all the variables one by one. Think of a variable as a box. It can store a certain value. The value of the variables can also be changed. Arrays are a collection of variabes of the same type(ie. int, double, string). Do note that all index in coding starts from 0. This means to access first variable in the array is arr[0] and not arr[1]. In 2d arrays, it is always rows(horizontal) first, den column(vertical). arr[row][column].
